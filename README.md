## Project Overview

**Gipity AI Dev Kit (ADK)** gives you a **production-ready foundation** for building full-stack web, PWA, and native iOS/Android apps, with Supabase integration for **auth, database, and file storage** all set up from day one from a single codebase.

Instead of starting from scratch, Gipity provides:

* A pre-built, **Supabase-ready architecture**
* **Secure APIs** for your app logic
* **Dev/prod switching** for real-world deployment
* **1-click native build preparation** for iOS & Android via Ionic Appflow

Built for AI-assisted coding, but with **best practices baked in** so your app launches fast ‚Äî and right.

**Built with:** Replit ‚Ä¢ Supabase ‚Ä¢ Ionic Appflow ‚Ä¢ React ‚Ä¢ TypeScript ‚Ä¢ Tailwind CSS ‚Ä¢ Vite ‚Ä¢ Capacitor

## Security Notes
- Do not commit secrets (API or Supabase keys, SMTP credentials, etc) to GitHub. Use Replit Secrets
- Never expose API keys in client-side code or public repos
- If a password or key is exposed, change it and update Replit Secrets immediately
- Never use the `supabase_service_role_key` on the app front-end; it is for back-end/server-side only
