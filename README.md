## **Clarification on documentation, including this readme**

This **Readme document** and the **replit.md instruction file** are the key documents to understanding the ***Gipity*** scaffold app.

However, the current versions were written by *Replit agent* as placeholders. They are only intended at this time to give a flavour, and may not be accurate. They have not been read, reviewed or verified by any human *Gipity* eyes.

## üì± Deploy to Mobile (Optional - 10 Minutes)

Ready to create native iOS and Android apps? Follow these steps:

### **Prerequisites Setup** (One-time)
- GitHub account with new empty repository named `[yourapp]-appflow`  
- Apple Developer account (for iOS apps)
- Google Play Developer account (for Android apps)
- Ionic Appflow account (free tier available)

### **Environment Variables** (Required for mobile)
Add these to your Replit Secrets:
```bash
# App Identity
APP_ID=com.yourcompany.yourapp
APP_NAME=Your App Name
APP_SCHEME=YourApp
APP_USER_AGENT=YourApp

# GitHub Integration  
GITHUB_USERNAME=your-github-username
APPFLOW_REPO_URL=yourapp-appflow
```

### **Generate App Assets** (One-time)
1. Create master images in `master-images/` folder:
   - `icon-master.png` (1024x1024px, transparent background)
   - `logo-master.png` (480x128px, transparent background)
   - `splash-square-master.png` (2732x2732px, optional background)
   - `splash-android-portrait-master.png` (1280x1920px)
   - `splash-android-landscape-master.png` (1920x1280px)
   - `splash-icon-square-master.png` (1024x1024px, transparent)

2. Run the image generator:
```bash
python3 gipity-scripts/gipity-image-resizer.py
```

### **Deploy to App Stores**
