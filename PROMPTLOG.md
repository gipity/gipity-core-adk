# Promptlog

## Relationship between CHANGELOG.md PROMPTLOG.md files
This PROMPTLOG.md contains useful AI agent prompts to fix and enhance the Gipity AI Dev Kit (ADK). The prompts will include some used during changes logged in the CHANGELOG.md file.

*Remember that AI agent prompts aren't exact, and re-running prompts is not guaranteed to provide the same results each time. You should verify they do what you require, and use them as a template to be modified for your own purposes if needed.*
