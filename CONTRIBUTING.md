# Contributing to the Gipity AI Dev Kit (ADK)

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

For the initial stages of this project, I’m focusing on building and refining the first few versions of the ADK app myself. This helps ensure the architecture and approach are consistent before opening up wider collaboration.

## Current Contribution Policy

- **Pull Requests:**  
  At this time, I’m unlikely to accept PRs directly into the repo. This is just so I can keep early development focused and cohesive.  
  If you have an idea or spot an issue, please start a discussion first (see below).

- **Future Contributions:**  
  Once the early versions are stable, I’ll review how best to open up the repo for PRs. At that point, I’ll document coding style, branch workflows, and review process here.

## How to Share and Discuss Ideas
For ideas for enhancements, bug reports, suggestions for improvements and questions about the code:

- Use the **Issues** tab on GitHub
- Join the Gipity **Support Hub** at [www.gipity.com](https://www.gipity.com)
- Email me at [steve@gipity.com](mailto:steve@gipity.com) - I welcome all conversations

Thanks for your interest in the Gipity AI Dev Kit (ADK). I really value your input, even if we’re not merging code just yet.
